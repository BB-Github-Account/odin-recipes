        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A great recipe for a fresh batch of soft christmas cookies. Don't forget you can also 
            top with frosting after the cookies have had some time to cool or sprinkle on some sugar 
            right before you bake. For the best results it's important to remember to mix the dry ingredients 
            in a separate bowl, chill the dough in the fridge before baking, and to bake the cookies until the 
            edges are golden.
